# Kickstarter Crowfunding Analysis

## Background

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. In this assignment, we will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.




* Add up each of the values in the `Number Successful`, `Number Failed`, and `Number Canceled` columns to populate the `Total Projects` column. Then, using a mathematical formula, find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.

* Create a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure, or cancellation.

## Submission

* To submit your homework, upload the solution and files to a GitHub repo, Dropbox, or Google Drive and submit the link to <https://bootcampspot.com/>.
